# Employee Tracker SQL

 SQL Project

## Descritption

This project has a CMS interface that allows non-developers an easy way to access and interact with databases.  Here I have created a database for an employer to view all aspects within their company.  Keep track of departments, roles, salaries, and employees.  Employers can even add and update aspects while in the interface.
